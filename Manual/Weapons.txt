----- MiG-21bis Weapons -----

The MiG-21 comes with a wide array of armament options

External tanks:
	490l (pylons 3, 4 and center)
	800l (center pylon only)

	Note: The MiG doesn't have a massive range,
		you'll probably need ext. tanks for every mission

Bombs:
	FAB-100/100x4/250/500:
		all wing pylons
		numbers represent the mass in kg
		dumb freefall irons
		for aiming use the included .csv file to set the pipper depression angle
		
		Weapon selector needs to be in B RKT at the appropriate pylons
		When pressing armament release,
			a single bomb will be dropped from each of the selected pylons
		
	RN-28:
		center pylon
		nuclear free fall bomb
		not implemented, (intentionally) it's just dead weight

Rockets:
	UB-16 (all wing pylons)
	UB-32 (pylons 1 and 2)
		16/32 55 mm unguided rocket per pod
		pylon selector must be in B RKT
		numbers represent the amount of rockets to salvo fire from each wing
	
	S-24 (all wing pylons)
		Big unguided rockets
		pylon selector to S-24 with the appropriate pylons
		rockets from both of the selected pylons will√© be salvo launched when pressing  release
	
	Note:
		There's no speciall aid to aiming rockets,but you're probably best off with the fixed net.
		Other than that use your Mk.1 eyeball and experiance

Guided A/G missiles:
	Kh-66 "Grom" (All wing pylons):
		Beam riding missile
		hard to aim, not the most practical but fun
		Radar must bee on and in beam mode
		Pylon selector needs to be in IR-SAR
		position determins the priority pylon, but once it's fired you can fire a next one without changing to a new pylon

	Kh-25MP (Pylons 1 and 2):
		Anti-radiation missile
		Pylon selector needs to be in S-24 1-2. You'll fire off one at a time
		You don't lock the target, it's a maddog. You aim, shoot and it will track whatever it finds infront of itself

A/A Missiles:
	R-3S/R (All wing pylons)
		short range AIM-9 knockoffs
		S: Heat seeker
		R: SARH

	R-60 (All wing pylons)
	R-60 2x (pylons 3, 4)
		small, short range IR missiles
		superior to R-3
		Quite agile
	
	R-27R1/T1 (pylons 1, 2)
		Medium range A/A missiles
		R1: SARH
		T1: IR

	A/A missile engagement:
		IR:
			Weapon mode selectors to Air and IR	
			Pylon selector to IR-SAR with the appropriate pylon
			Manuver so that the target is ruffly in the center of the gunsight
			When one of the 3 green lights directly to the right of the gunsight light up, the seeker has a target
			Press armament release and call FOX 2 on the radio

		SARH:
			Weapon selectors to Air and SAR
			Radar on (description about radar below) and target locked
			Pylon selector to IR-SAR with desired pylon
			Press armament release
			Since it's a semi-active radar homing missile, the lock needs to be maintained until the missile hits

Radar operation:
	Radar control panel (forward part of right panel with 3 switches and lights)
		Forward most switch:
			Bottom: OFF
			Middle: SBY
			Top: ON
		Middle: alt modes, not yet implemented
		Aft: Beam mode on/off
	Before switching the radar on, it must be in SBY to warm up for 2-3 min
	The radar can also overheat.
		~20 min when on
		~2 hr in SBY
	
	The radar shows contacts in B-scan format
	T means contact is below you
	+ means contact is ruffly coaltitude with you
	upside down T means contact is above you

	Lockin a target:
		Manuver so the target is within the vertical bars on the radar display
		Move the lock bars over the target
		Hit lock
	
	Once a target is locked, the display changes to azimuth elevation
	Range is indicated by the triangles on the two scales coming out of the center to the left and right

	IFF:
		Click the button labeled IFF to toggle the interrogator
		Atm not really realistic, radar will display the callsign of all contacts
	
Guns:
	Set the target's wingspam on the gyro sight
	referance the red window for 300 m mode, the knob for manual mode

	300 m mode:
		put the throttle drum (same as lock bars) to the aftmost position to enter 300 m mode
		the pipper will show the point where the bullets will be when they are 300 m away from you
		manuver so that the pipper is on the target
		When the diamonds touch the wingtip, (if you have set the wingspam correctly) you are 300 m away and ready to fire
	
	Radar mode:
		Lock the target
		Pipper will represent the point where the bullet will be when at the target's distance

	Unjamming:
		Guns can get jammed. If it happens, press one of the unjamm buttons (Labeled 1, 2, 3 left of the gunsight)

RWR:
	It's nothing fancy.
	Flashing light and tone indicates an aircraft being picked up
	The 4 lights represent the ruff directions.
	IMPORTANT: The quaters intersect each other
		An aircraft can be indicated by multiple lights at once
		More on this in the examples
	
	You can switch between day (yellow) and night (red)
	Also included is a test switch in the middle.

	Here are some examples:
	X |
	--+--
	  |
	means there's one or more aircrafts forward/right of you. faster the flashes, the closer. steady is lauch
	Same for all directions

	X | X
	--+--
	  |
	There's two possibilities:
		1) An aircraft directly at your 12
		2) one or more aircrafts forward of you both to the left and to the right

Hope this helps :D
